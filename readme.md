# Team-Project Matcher

Team-Project Matcher is a repository that showcases examples of using NearestNeighbors and Annoy algorithms to match teams with projects based on their characteristics. This repository also includes a benchmark comparison between the two solutions.

## Features

- **NearestNeighbors Example**: Demonstrates how to utilize the NearestNeighbors algorithm to match teams with projects by calculating the nearest neighbors based on their feature vectors.

- **Annoy Example**: Illustrates the usage of the Annoy library to perform fast approximate nearest neighbor searches for team-project matching.

- **Benchmark Comparison**: Provides a benchmark analysis comparing the performance and accuracy of NearestNeighbors and Annoy approaches when matching teams with projects.
